## Project Report :

## Objective :

The purpose of this excercise is to preform  semantic segmentation by developing a deep learning network that locates a particular human target within an image.This deep learning model that will allow a simulated quadcopter to follow around the person that it detects!

## Network Architecture : 

__**Objective :**__ The goal of  this exercise is  to implement a PD controller to control the height of a quadrotor, as well
as tune its gains. The controller only contains a Proportional and Derivate gain. In addition the input should
have a rise time of less than 1s and a maximum overshoot of less than 5%.
